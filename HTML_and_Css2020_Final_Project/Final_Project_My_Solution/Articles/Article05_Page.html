    <p>Blues is a music genre and musical form which was originated in the Deep South of the United States around the 1870s by African-Americans from roots in African 
        musical traditions, African-American work songs, and spirituals. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative 
        ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord 
        progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or "worried notes"), usually thirds, fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch are also an 
        essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.
        Blues as a genre is also characterized by its lyrics, bass lines, and instrumentation. Early traditional blues verses consisted of a single line repeated four times. 
        It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the AAB pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four 
        first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative, 
        often relating the racial discrimination and other challenges experienced by African-Americans.
        The term Blues may have come from "blue devils", meaning melancholy and sadness; an early use of the term in this sense is in George Colman's one-act farce Blue Devils 
        (1798). The phrase blue devils may also have been derived from Britain in the 1600s, when the term referred to the "intense visual hallucinations that can accompany 
        severe alcohol withdrawal". As time went on, the phrase lost the reference to devils, and "it came to mean a state of agitation or depression." 
        By the 1800s in the United States, the term blues was associated with drinking alcohol, a meaning which survives in the phrase blue law, which prohibits the sale of
        alcohol on Sunday. Though the use of the phrase in African-American music may be older, it has been attested to in print since 1912, when Hart Wand's 
        "Dallas Blues" became the first copyrighted blues composition. In lyrics the phrase is often used to describe a depressed mood. It is in this sense of a sad state of 
        mind that one of the earliest recorded references to "the blues" was written by Charlotte Forten, then aged 25, in her diary on December 14, 1862. 
        She was a free-born black from Pennsylvania who was working as a schoolteacher in South Carolina, instructing both slaves and freedmen, and wrote that she 
        "came home with the blues" because she felt lonesome and pitied herself. She overcame her depression and later noted a number of songs, such as Poor Rosy, 
        that were popular among the slaves. Although she admitted being unable to describe the manner of singing she heard, Forten wrote that 
        the songs "can't be sung without a full heart and a troubled spirit", conditions that have inspired countless blues songs.

        So, Why Do the Blues Make Us Feel So Good? Alan Shapiro explains the reasons: 
    <br/>
        One of the new things the blues brought to music is what has been called “blues tonality”, and writers have pointed to opposites in this tonal quality. 
        Frank Tirro, in Jazz: A History, describes it as “the simultaneous use of major and minor.” And Hugues Panassié, in The Real Jazz, writes, 
        “the major includes in its sphere the minor mode from which it borrows its melancholy and sorrow.” This is technical, but it arose from and meets a deep hope in 
        the human self—in our selves: the hope to make sense of the world as having darkness, sadness, pain, and the world as having sunlight, joy, pleasure. That’s one reason 
        Joe Williams’ singing “Everyday I Have the Blues” gets us: We feel joy and sadness at once, as the band plays in a predominantly major key, while he sings in the 
        minor.Bessie SmithAnother fine instance of that oneness of pain and pleasure is Bessie Smith’s 1928 recording of “Thinking Blues.” 
        As you’ll hear, there is a wail in her voice, but there is also triumph and joy. For instance, as she sings the words “ever” and “thousand,” there is agony in her 
        sliding blue notes, yet there is lightness, too; her voice rises on those words, giving them a lift. And as she sustains the word “old” at the start of the second 
        verse, she sounds, strong, assertive, but there is a beautiful trembling in her vibrato. Throughout, Bessie Smith’s voice is deep and bright, rich and piercing. 
        As she sings, we feel the painful and the pleasing don’t have to fight; they can go together beautifully.
    <br/>
    <br/>
        The blues points to a critical question for every person: What do we do with our sadness, pain, and disappointment? Do we use them to see more meaning in things and 
        people? Do we use them to be kinder? Or do we use them to feel the whole world is bad, and to retreat from or lash out at other people? This, Aesthetic Realism explains, 
        is the central fight in the mind of every person between the desire to like and respect the world, and the desire for contempt, which Eli Siegel defined as the 
        “disposition in every person to think we will be for ourselves by making less of the outside world.” Contempt is as ordinary as a son not giving full attention to his 
        mother, thinking, “I know what she’s going to say.” But it is the cause of all unkindness, including racism and economic injustice, which so many African-American 
        blues artists suffered from, and people suffer from right now. But no one can like themselves for having contempt.
    <br/>
        The blues as musical form is against depression, even as the lyrics may describe that depressed feeling. This is explained greatly in a paper titled “Feeling Bad, 
        Good Will, and the Blues” by Ellen Reiss, who is the Chairman of Education at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation in New York City, and with whom I’m honored to study 
        in professional classes. We heard that in both the Joe Williams and Bessie Smith recordings: those mournful, painful, harmonically contradictory blue notes become 
        part of a stirring composition. Aesthetic Realism defines good will as “the desire to have something else stronger and more beautiful, for this desire makes 
        oneself stronger and more beautiful.” And Ellen Reiss shows in this paper that the blues is good will because it arises from the desire to give honest form to 
        one’s complaints, one’s pain—literally to make music out of them!—and to give honest pleasure to other people. This is thrilling—tremendous both as music 
        criticism and as the understanding of every person!
