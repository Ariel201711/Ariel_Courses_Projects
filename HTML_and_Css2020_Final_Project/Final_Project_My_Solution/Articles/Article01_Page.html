    <p>Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western culture, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. 
        While a more precise term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time 
        from before the 6th century AD to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition 
        became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. Given the wide range of styles in European classical music, 
        from Medieval plainchant sung by monks to Classical and Romantic symphonies for orchestra from the 1700s and 1800s to avant-garde atonal compositions from the 1900s, 
        it is difficult to list characteristics that can be attributed to all works of that type. Nonetheless, a universal characteristic of classical music written since the 
        late 13th century is the invariable appliance of a standardized system of precise mensural notation (which evolved into modern bar notation after 1600) 
        for all compositions and their accurate performance. Another is the creation and development of complex pieces of solo instrumental works. 
        The first symphonies were produced during the Classical period; beginning in the mid 18th century, the symphony ensemble and the compositions 
        became prominent features of Classical-period music. The instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid-19th century 
        (often much earlier) and systematized in the 18th and 19th centuries. They consist of the instruments found in an orchestra or in a concert band, 
        together with several other solo instruments (such as the piano, harpsichord, and organ). The symphony orchestra includes members of the string, woodwind, 
        brass, and percussion families of instruments. The concert band consists of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families. It generally has a larger 
        variety and number of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section. However, many concert bands use a double bass. 
        The vocal practices changed over the classical period, from the single line monophonic Gregorian chant done by monks in the Medieval period to the complex, 
        polyphonic choral works of the Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time.

    So, Can listening to classical music improve your life? Here is Clemency Burton-Hill Answer: 
    <br/>
    "It turned out that, when I converted my listening habits into a conscious daily ritual, I began to feel less anxious almost immediately. 
        I curated myself monthly classical playlists with a specific piece for each day. Getting on the Tube and pressing play, 
        instead of automatically being sucked into a social media scroll hole, seemed to be spiritually stabilising. I began to look disproportionately forward to it. 
        And it occurred to me that, if I could benefit in such a meaningful way from this small but powerful act of soul maintenance, so might others. What if 
        I could build on my lifetime’s love of classical music? What if I could open up this vast treasury of musical riches by demystifying both the music and 
        humanising those who created it by giving each piece some context, telling some stories, and reminding readers/listeners that this music was created by a real person, 
        probably someone who shared many of the same concerns as them, who in many ways might be just like them. I believe the greatest works of music are engines of empathy: 
        they allow us to travel without moving into other lives, ages, souls. They are also robust: they can handle you multitasking all around them, fitting them into your 
        real life. So don’t give another thought to whether you have the right ‘credentials’ to become a classical aficionado or whether you’re listening 'right’: trust me, 
        the only entry criterion is to have ears. You can listen on your commute; take them with you on a walk; stick them on in the background while you hustle your kids’ 
        breakfast or do the school run; make them your soundtrack to fixing dinner, pouring a drink, putting your feet up, or doing the washing, ironing, catching up with 
        emails, whatever it is you need to do at the moment where you get to finally press play. I believe there is very little in life that this music can’t beautifully 
        complement. This is music to live to — to live your best life to."</p>
