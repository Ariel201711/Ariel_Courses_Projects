    <p> Hip hop music, also called rap music, is a genre of popular music developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans and Latino Americans in the Bronx 
        borough of New York City in the 1970s. It consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. 
        It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and 
        graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds, and rhythmic beatboxing. While often used to 
        refer solely to rapping, "hip hop" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture. The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term 
        rap music, though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing, turntablism, 
        scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.
        The creation of the term hip hop is often credited to Keith Cowboy, rapper with Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. However, Lovebug Starski, Keith Cowboy, and 
        DJ Hollywood used the term when the music was still known as disco rap. It is believed that Cowboy created the term while teasing a friend who had just joined the U.S. 
        Army, by scat singing the words "hip/hop/hip/hop" in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of soldiers marching. Cowboy later worked the "hip hop" cadence into a 
        part of his stage performance, which was quickly used by other artists such as The Sugarhill Gang in "Rapper's Delight". Universal Zulu Nation founder Afrika Bambaataa 
        is credited with first using the term to describe the subculture in which the music belonged; although it is also suggested that it was a derogatory term to describe 
        the type of music. The first use of the term in print was in a January 1982 interview of Afrika Bambaataa by Michael Holman in the East Village Eye. The term gained 
        further currency in September of that year in another Bambaataa interview in The Village Voice, by Steven Hager, later author of a 1984 history of hip hop.

        Starting from humble roots, hip-hop has grown from the creative outlet of underrepresented black teenagers living in the South Bronx in the late 1970s to a highly 
        successful commercialized business that in 2000 grossed over $1.8 billion in sales in the United States. (Kun, 581) Hip-hop is not only successful in the United States, 
        but also, its influence has permeated the entire planet, becoming a global creative and economic force. Historically the genre has been considered representative of 
        the voice of the black community, but some critics argue that the commercialization and globalization of hip-hop music dilutes its message so that the genre no longer 
        truly represents the voice of the black community. In his 1999 manifesto “Fear Not of Man,” the highly acclaimed rapper Mos Def proclaims, “We are hip-hop.” 
        (Mos Def, 1999) Who is the “we” Mos Def is referring to? Who exactly constitutes hip-hop? Traditionally this “we” would be interpreted as America’s black community, 
        but, as we have seen, the consumers and producers of hip-hop have expanded far beyond the black community. Mos Def recognizes the ever expanding base of hip-hop and 
        later in “Fear Not of Man” states that, “Me, you, everybody – we are hip-hop,” suggesting that hip-hop music no longer solely represents solely the voice of the black 
        community, instead, hip-hop now represents all those who partake in or promote hip-hop culture whether male or female, rich or poor, black or white, American or 
        foreign, and so on. (Mos Def, 1999)
        In today’s commercial world, hip-hop has even gone so far as to represent various companies and products. After an analysis of the roots of hip-hop and the growing 
        commercialization and globalization of the genre, it becomes evident that Mos Def’s assessment is correct and hip-hop currently represents far more than the black 
        community. The roots of hip-hop date back to the South Bronx in the 1970s, when the construction of the Cross-Bronx expressway displaced many black and Hispanic 
        families while many whites fled the area. Renewal projects also caused massive relocations of economically delicate blacks and Hispanics into the South Bronx. 
        (Rose, 30) These displaced citizens were left with “few city resources, fragmented leadership, and limited political power” and the South Bronx started to become 
        depicted as “drained of life, energy, and vitality.” (Rose, 33)  
        The youngest generation of these relocated families began frantically searching for outlets to channel their creativity and aggression, 
        and soon hip-hop emerged, providing black youths with an identity and cultural support groups through deejaying, rapping, break dancing, and graffiti production. 
        (Rose, 33-34) Author Tricia Rose suggests in her seminal masterpiece, Black Noise, that rap is deeply rooted in “premodern oral traditions” while hip-hop itself 
        follows in the footsteps of previous black musical styles such as jazz, blues, and southern soul music. (Rose, 21, 185) These genres of music all have historic roots in
        black culture and society and were later commercialized and expanded to wider audiences, both globally and ethnically: something that is currently happening to hip-hop.

        Hip hop's early evolution into a form distinct from R&B also, not coincidentally, occurred around the time that sampling technology and drum-machines became widely 
        available to the general public at a cost that was affordable to the average consumer—not just professional studios. Drum-machines and samplers were combined in 
        machines that came to be known as MPC's or 'Music Production Centers', early examples of which would include the Linn 9000. The first sampler that was broadly adopted 
        to create this new kind of music was the Mellotron used in combination with the TR-808 drum machine. Mellotrons and Linn's were succeeded by the AKAI, in the late 1980s.
        Turntablist techniques – such as rhythmic "scratching" (pushing a record back and forth while the needle is in the groove to create new sounds and sound effects, an 
        approach attributed to Grand Wizzard Theodore), beat mixing and/or beatmatching, and beat juggling – eventually developed along with the percussion breaks, creating a 
        musical accompaniment or base that could be rapped over in a manner similar to signifying. As well, the art of Jamaican toasting, a style of talking or chanting into a 
        microphone, often in a boastful style, while beats play over a sound system, was an important influence on the development of hip hop music.
