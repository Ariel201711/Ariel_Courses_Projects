    <p>Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, 
        and developed into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s and later, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
        It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues, rhythm and blues, and from country music. 
        Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical styles.
        Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more singers. 
        Usually, rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a verse–chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. 
        Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.
        By the late 1960s "classic rock" period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, 
        country rock, southern rock, raga rock, and jazz rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the 
        countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements, glam rock, 
        which highlighted showmanship and visual style, and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. 
        In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques.
        Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music 
        and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, 
        electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop 
        revivals in the early 2000s. The late 2000s and 2010s saw a slow decline in the cultural relevancy of the genre, being usurped by hip-hop as the most 
        popular genre in the United States in 2017.
    <br/>
        The sound of rock is traditionally centered on the amplified electric guitar, which emerged in its modern form in the 1950s with the popularity of rock and roll. 
        Also, it was influenced by the sounds of electric blues guitarists. The sound of an electric guitar in rock music is typically supported by an electric bass guitar, 
        which pioneered in jazz music in the same era, and percussion produced from a drum kit that combines drums and cymbals. This trio of instruments has often been 
        complemented by the inclusion of other instruments, particularly keyboards such as the piano, the Hammond organ, and the synthesizer. The basic rock instrumentation 
        was derived from the basic blues band instrumentation (prominent lead guitar, second chordal instrument, bass, and drums). A group of musicians performing rock music 
        is termed as a rock band or a rock group. Furthermore, it typically consists of between three (the power trio) and five members. Classically, a rock band takes the 
        form of a quartet whose members cover one or more roles, including vocalist, lead guitarist, rhythm guitarist, bass guitarist, drummer, and often keyboard player or 
        other instrumentalist.
        A simple 4/4 drum pattern common in rock music About this soundPlay (help·info)
        Rock music is traditionally built on a foundation of simple unsyncopated rhythms in a 4/4 meter, 
        with a repetitive snare drum back beat on beats two and four. Melodies often originate from older musical modes such as the Dorian and Mixolydian, 
        as well as major and minor modes. Harmonies range from the common triad to parallel perfect fourths and fifths and dissonant harmonic progressions. 
        Since the late 1950s and particularly from the mid 1960s onwards, rock music often used the verse-chorus structure derived from blues and folk music, 
        but there has been considerable variation from this model. Critics have stressed the eclecticism and stylistic diversity of rock. Because of its complex
        history and its tendency to borrow from other musical and cultural forms, it has been argued that "it is impossible to bind rock music to a rigidly delineated 
        musical definition."

        So, What about Rock? Is this genner is still alive? Here is Caren Gibson Explanation: 
    <br/>
        First the classic artists will be discussed. They’re not getting any younger, but even though they’re still big draws at the box office, they obviously won’t be around 
        forever. Then the conversation will turn to more current rock acts who can easily draw a crowd. And yet, though the young hopefuls may be capable of filling arenas on 
        their own – be they Queens Of The Stone Age, Black Stone Cherry or Twenty One Pilots – it’s left undecided as to whether they have what it takes to reach the lofty 
        heights of Festival Headliner.
        Sometimes pundits will get involved. Industry “experts” will add their thoughts and opinions on whether rock music is dead in an attempt to add some weight to the 
        discussion. 
        Then the musicians wade in, explaining how rock bands are regurgitating the same old clichéd riffs and tired ideas, often in an attempt to promote their own clichéd 
        riffs and tired ideas; 
        after all, aren’t they the very people in a position to change the ship’s course and steer away from the oncoming iceberg?
        But then, in 2017, music changed. A study conducted by Nielsen in the US concluded that hip-hop and R&B overtook rock as the most-consumed genre for the first time 
        ever. Taking into consideration album sales, downloads and audio/video streams, only two non-hip-hop or R&B artists featured in the entire Top 10 
        (Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift), while those genres have also been cited as a factor in the rise of on-demand streaming services in the US.
        The report also found that Metallica were 2017’s best-performing rock artists, off the back of their 2016 release of Hardwired… To Self-Destruct, and a slew of 
        revamped, repackaged and expanded reissues, including the thrash classics Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets; a re-selling of their back catalogue to capitalise 
        on their longevity, perhaps. For it is, of course, in album sales that rock truly reigns.
        Michael Jackson still holds the top spot for the biggest selling non-compilation album of all time in Thriller, with around 66 million claimed in sales. 
        However, other albums that have exceeded sales of 40 million include Eagles with Their Greatest Hits (1971-75) and Hotel California, 
        AC/DC’s Back In Black, Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side Of The Moon, Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell, and Rumours by Fleetwood Mac, with Whitney Houston and the Bee Gees as 
        the only other artists to have an album whose sales have exceeded 40 million.
    <br/>
    <br/>
        With album sales seeing a steady decline in recent years, it may stand that Michael Jackson will never lose the accolade of biggest-selling album of all time. 
        And hip-hop and R&B can have their day in the sun when it comes to streaming and radio airplay, for it’s in the live arena that rock music still reigns supreme. 
        In 2017, Guns N’ Roses earned almost half a billion dollars for their Not In This Lifetime… tour. That’s the fourth-highest grossing tour of all time behind other 
        rock giants Coldplay, The Rolling Stones and U2.
        At the end of it all, rock is music’s greatest survivor and has weathered the storm of changing trends for around seven decades. Legends weren’t born overnight and, 
        as hard as it is to believe now, there was a world before the likes of Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Black Sabbath, et al. 
        They were all unknown bands to start with, and it’s only through time – and their timelessness – that they’ve earned such enduring appeal. 
        Rock music lives on in spite of cultural trends, which is exactly what all of the above bands exist to rebel against. Will any of them be headlining festivals in 2028? 
        If only we had a time machine to find out.
