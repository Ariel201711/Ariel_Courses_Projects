    <p>Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States,in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in 
        blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the common bonds of 
        African-American and European-American musical parentage. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. 
        Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions.
        As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 
        1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. 
        In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that 
        emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging 
        "musician's music" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, 
        smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.
        The origin of the word jazz has resulted in considerable research, and its history is well documented. It is believed to be related to jasm, 
        a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning "pep, energy". The earliest written record of the word is in a 1912 article in the Los Angeles Times in which a minor league 
        baseball pitcher described a pitch which he called a "jazz ball" "because it wobbles and you simply can't do anything with it".
        The use of the word in a musical context was documented as early as 1915 in the Chicago Daily Tribune. Its first documented use in a musical context in New Orleans 
        was in a November 14, 1916 Times-Picayune article about "jas bands". In an interview with NPR, musician Eubie Blake offered his recollections of the slang 
        connotations of the term, saying, "When Broadway picked it up, they called it 'J-A-Z-Z'. It wasn't called that. It was spelled 'J-A-S-S'. 
        That was dirty, and if you knew what it was, you wouldn't say it in front of ladies." The American Dialect Society named it the Word of the 20th Century.
        Jazz is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of music spanning a period of over 100 years, from ragtime to the rock-infused fusion. Attempts have 
        been made to define jazz from the perspective of other musical traditions, such as European music history or African music. 
        But critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt argues that its terms of reference and its definition should be broader, defining jazz as a "form of art music which originated in 
        the United States through the confrontation of the Negro with European music" and arguing that it differs from European music in that jazz has a "special relationship 
        to time defined as 'swing'". Jazz involves "a spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a role" and contains a "sonority and manner 
        of phrasing which mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician". In the opinion of Robert Christgau, "most of us would say that inventing meaning while 
        letting loose is the essence and promise of jazz".
        A broader definition that encompasses different eras of jazz has been proposed by Travis Jackson: 
        "it is music that includes qualities such as swing, improvising, group interaction, developing an 'individual voice', 
        and being open to different musical possibilities". Krin Gibbard argued that "jazz is a construct" which designates "a number of musics with enough in common to be 
        understood as part of a coherent tradition". In contrast to commentators who have argued for excluding types of jazz, musicians are sometimes reluctant to define the 
        music they play. Duke Ellington, one of jazz's most famous figures, said, "It's all music."

    So, Is jazz entering a new golden age? Here is the Answer: 
    <br/>
    If you think you’ve seen more attention devoted to jazz in the past year or so, you’re not wrong. Thanks in part to a spotlight aimed by Kendrick Lamar – 
        whose album To Pimp a Butterfly prominently featured contemporary names like pianist Robert Glasper and saxophonist Kamasi Washington – there’s been an 
        overall renaissance in press coverage for a genre that has, in recent decades, often seemed ignored by the popular media. Jazz’s resurgent profile, however, 
        isn’t merely due to one rapper’s significant influence. Lamar-associate Washington has received a large amount of the recent attention mostly on the strength 
        of the saxophonist’s 2015 triple album, The Epic. Pianist Vijay Iyer was the subject of a long feature in the New Yorker, while his collaboration with longtime 
        experimental icon Wadada Leo Smith resulted in a “best new music” garland from Pitchfork." At the same time, it’s become more common to see contemporary pop stars 
        displaying their jazz bona fides with pride: witness Lady Gaga pairing up with Tony Bennett for an album, or the wealth of producers, DJs and MCs 
        (such as Tyler, the Creator) eager to name-drop their favorite vintage jazz records. At the midway point of another strong year in jazz – with distinctive releases 
        in the sub-genre realms of acoustic classicism, funk exploration and avant-garde fire – we’ve devised a cheat sheet to help you understand this welcome turn in the
        zeitgeist, along with some listening recommendations.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Given that jazz was originated and developed by African American artists during the era of Jim Crow racism, its status as a music that can be both populist and 
        experimental at once should come as little surprise. That multi-purpose tradition continues, especially when artists place politics in the foreground – 
        as sometime Branford Marsalis bassist Eric Revis does on the finale of his latest trio record (recorded with pianist Kris Davis and drummer Gerald Cleaver). 
        Titled Anamnesis: Pt 1 & Pt 2 (For Tamir and Ms Bland), the song is, in its first half, a melodic-if-subdued memorial to black citizens either killed by police 
        (as with the shooting of Tamir Rice) or else found dead while in police custody (as happened in the case of Sandra Bland). In its final minutes, the composition 
        turns into a percussive protest over this particularly dispiriting pattern of violence in contemporary American life.
    <br/>
    The liner notes for Allen’s album Americana include a famous quotation from writer Albert Murray that seems applicable to work this strong: 
        “The blues is not the creation of a crushed-spirit people. It is the product of a forward-looking, upward-striving people.” That was true when the late African 
        American critic and scholar said it, and it remains true in jazz today.
